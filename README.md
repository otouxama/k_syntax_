# k_syntax_

A mini macro library in C designed like an esoteric programming language.

I call it 'K' :D

its actually very simple, dont expect much from it.

###### why this README is so short?

make sure u compile it like

```batch
gcc [YOUR_FILE].c k_syntax_source.c -o [YOUR_EXECUTABLE]
```
that source file is necessary.

how does a regular k program look like?

```cpp
// get the k_syntax header and its source in a folder/directory.
#include "k_syntax.h"

start
 output("hi.\n"); // 'hi'
 joutput("wassup light_jh1.\n"); // 'wassup light-san'.
end
```

enjoy!
